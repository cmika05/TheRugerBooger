    <p>I was born in Colorado Springs,CO 2015 in late December. My mommie got me as a valentines day present in 2016.I am a well kept cat. I have all the luxuries in the world. I live in a house with my mommie and my brother,Piggy.

        My day starts with chasing my brother around the house and playing with him. I eat my breakfast and sunbathe myself next to the patio where I look at birds and squirrels in my backyard.I crackle at mommie to let me outside so I can chase them.(Mommie doesn't let me out because I had jumped fences once and spend a whole night outside).I try to take a nap on the dinner table after my bird watching. I try to sleep throughout the day while my mommie is at work.</p>

    <p> When mommie comes back from work.I beg her for attention and demand my treats.Mommie always falls for my cute self and gives me everything I want.After I get my treats I get zoomies and I chase imaginary friends around the house.After my zoomies workout I like to take another nap before mommie gives me dinner.I like to join my mommie while she watches TV before going to bed.I usually sleep with my mommie and cuddle her.</p>

    <p>During summer my mom takes me for a walk in my stroller or my cat carrier.I  enjoy that. During winter I don't like going outside because of the snow.Every halloween mommie dresses me up and gets me treats,last year I was a shark. Christmas time is my favorite because my mommie puts up a christmas tree where I  jump on it and try to knock it down. I love the christmas ornaments she puts on the tree because I like to bat them off the tree and kick them around. My mommie also celebrates my birthday every year. This year I turned 6. My brother was at my birthday dinner and I got a whole bunch of toys, treats and soft food for my birthday.</p>
